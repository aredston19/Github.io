<b> Andrew's journey to 100 miles and 100 beers. </b> <br>
<br>
<b>Miles: 48 </b> <br>
<b>Beer: 307 </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Day 3 </b>40
<br>
Day 3: 14.5 Miles. [48/100] <br>
Day 3: 13 Beers. [40/100]<br>
<br>
Today was Andrew's first day doubling. Andrew ran 14.5 miles today broken out into two runs: 10.5 miles in the morning with Claire on bike support and a 4 mile shakeout in the afternoon. 48 miles is the most Andrew has every run in 3 days, and is frequently what he averages for an entire week these days. The day continued with a bakers dozen of beers and Detective James McNulty, watching many a Wire episode. 
<br>
<br>
<b> Day 2 </b>
<br>
Day 2: 11.5 Miles. [33.5/100] <br>
Day 2: 13 Beers. [27/100]<br>
<br>
Day 2 started with an 11.5 mile shakeout run with Josh, featuring Claire zipping around on skates. So far, 33.5 miles, a new two day milleage personal record. <br>The party continued at Wrigley field where the crowd was able to see 2000 Pedro Martinez reincarnated as Bowden Francis. The Blue Jays snuck out with a 1-0 win, a true masterclass in pitching from both Francis and Shota Imanaga, which made us forget this baseball game as exciting as watching paint dry.
<br>
<br>
<b> Day 1 </b> 
<br>
Day 1: 22 Miles.<br>
Day 1: 14 Beers.<br>
<br>
Day 1 started with the Fleet Feet Racing Team long run where Andrew had his longest run of 2024. It was subsequently followed up with a full afternoon of beverages and some competitive Euchre. In the second and final game of a best 2 out of 3 series, Sam and Andrew defeated Michael and Matthew 10-0 in one of the most dominant Euchre performances in recent memory.
